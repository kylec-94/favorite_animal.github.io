		<p>The Heisenberg, commonly called "Walt" or "Walter" is a dangerous, carnivorous predator, which lurks in the New Mexico region of the United States. It is most notable for infecting its prey with a blue substance, which incapacitates the prey, allowing the Heisenberg to strike. It's origin is fabled to come from that of the Chupicabra, but it's true evolutionary chain is unknown. This predator is extremely cunning, and bold.</p>
